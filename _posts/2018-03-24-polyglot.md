A few months ago, I wrote my first package called {learner}. I finally took the time to put it on CRAN. Following the advice of a CRAN team member, I changed its name. I had to agree: it sounded like a machine learning package. So now the {learner} package is dead, long life to {[polyglot](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polyglot)}!

With {[polyglot](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polyglot)}, you can learn any two columns dataset directly in the R console:

## How to use {polyglot}

Let's imagine you want to see if you can remember some basic Japanese expressions[^1]. You would search online a two columns table and save it into the {polyglot} directory.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(polyglot) # install.packages("polyglot")

url1 <- "https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/japanese.php" 

japanese <- url1 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table() %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  write_csv(path = paste0("", system.file("extdata/", package =
  "polyglot"), "Japanese_54_Basic_Expressions.csv"))

as_tibble(japanese)
```

    ## # A tibble: 54 x 2
    ##                     English
    ##                       <chr>
    ##  1                  Welcome
    ##  2 Hello (General greeting)
    ##  3         Hello (on phone)
    ##  4             How are you?
    ##  5  Reply to 'How are you?'
    ##  6         Long time no see
    ##  7        What's your name?
    ##  8           My name is ...
    ##  9      Where are you from?
    ## 10             I'm from ...
    ## # ... with 44 more rows, and 1 more variables: `日本語 (Japanese)` <chr>

Or maybe you would like to see if you know most of the capitals in the world.

``` r
url2 <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_in_alphabetical_order"

capitals <- url2 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_node(".wikitable") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  select(Country, City, Notes) %>%
  arrange(Country) %>%
  write_csv(path = paste0("", system.file("extdata/", package =
  "polyglot"), "List_Capital_Cities.csv"))

as_tibble(capitals)
```

    ## # A tibble: 243 x 3
    ##                  Country                City
    ##                    <chr>               <chr>
    ##  1              Abkhazia             Sukhumi
    ##  2           Afghanistan               Kabul
    ##  3 Akrotiri and Dhekelia Episkopi Cantonment
    ##  4               Albania              Tirana
    ##  5               Algeria             Algiers
    ##  6        American Samoa           Pago Pago
    ##  7               Andorra    Andorra la Vella
    ##  8                Angola              Luanda
    ##  9              Anguilla          The Valley
    ## 10   Antigua and Barbuda          St. John's
    ## # ... with 233 more rows, and 1 more variables: Notes <chr>

You would just have to run the `learn` function to learn some Japanese vocabulary.

``` r
library(polyglot)
learn() # to launch the interactive learning environment
```

Before launching the interactive learning environment, be sure to have the [appropriate encoding](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/locales.html) and that your 2 or 3 columns dataset is a [CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

If your R console cannot read the Japanese characters, try the following:

``` r
# Make R reading Japanese
# Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Japanese")   # for Windows
# Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "ja_JP")       # for macOS 
# Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "ja_JP.utf8")  # for Modern Linux etc. 
```

Happy learning!

[^1]: For my part, all I know in Japanese is "arigato", "konnichiwa" and "moshi moshi".
