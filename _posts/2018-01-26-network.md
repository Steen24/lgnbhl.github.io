To begin this year, I was looking for a quick project related to social network visualization. As R analyses on [Game of Thrones](https://shiring.github.io/networks/2017/05/15/got_final), [Star Wars](https://rpubs.com/ogimenez/200849) or [The Lord of The Rings](http://mildlyscientific.schochastics.net/2016/08/10/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-three-networks/) have already been done, I decided to visualize the superhero network of the nowadays very popular Marvel movies saga. In this blog post, we will find out which characters and movies are the most central in the Marvel cinematic universe[^1].

[^1]: those who already know the Marvel movies will not learn anything new, except maybe how to use R for network visualizations.

## Scraping Marvel superheros

As often, the data can be found on Wikipedia. But surprisingly, the data needed was not avaiable in a English article, but within [this](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liste_des_films_de_l%27univers_cin%C3%A9matographique_Marvel&oldid=144793972#Personnages) French article.

Let's scrape this wikitable with the ```rvest``` package.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
# permanente link for reproductibility
url <- "https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liste_des_films_de_l%27univers_cin%C3%A9matographique_Marvel&oldid=144793972#Personnages"

marvel_df <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".wikitable") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  .[[5]]
```

Now that we have the data, we need to clean it and translate some superhero names in English. We also have to distinguish some movie names from characters.

``` r
# Distinguishing movies from characters
marvel_df[1,1] <- "Iron Man 1"
marvel_df[2,1] <- "The Incredible Hulk"
marvel_df[4,1] <- "Thor 1"
marvel_df[5,1] <- "Captain America 1"
marvel_df[11,1] <- "Avengers: Age of Ultron"
marvel_df[14,1] <- "Doctor Strange 1"
marvel_df[18,1] <- "Black Panther 1"
marvel_df[21,1] <- "Captain Marvel 1"
# # Giving characters their English names
colnames(marvel_df)[7] <- "Black Widow"
colnames(marvel_df)[8] <- "Hawkeye"
colnames(marvel_df)[10] <- "Scarlet Witch"
# Rename Value
marvel_df[marvel_df == ""] <- 0
marvel_df[marvel_df == "Oui"] <- 1
# Film variable as factor
marvel_df <- marvel_df %>% 
  mutate(Film = factor(Film, levels = unique(Film)))
```

## Reproducing the wikitable with a heatmap

Let's tidy the data in order to reproduce the Wikipedia table with ```ggplot2```. Note that the characters and movies are in a different order.

``` r
library(reshape2)
marvel_tidy <- melt(marvel_df, id.vars = "Film")
colnames(marvel_tidy) <- c("Film", "Character", "Value")

library(hrbrthemes)
ggplot(marvel_tidy, aes(x = Character, y = Film)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Value)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("0"="grey", "1"="lightgreen"),
                    name="", labels=c("Out","In")) + 
  labs(title = "Characters appearance in Marvel Movies",
       caption = "Chart CC-BY-SA; Author: Félix Luginbühl (@lgnbhl); Data source: Wikipedia") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))
```

## Centrality and closeness with iGraph

In order to know which characters and movies are the most central, we can use indicators like the degree (number of ties) and the closeness (centrality based on distance to others in the graph), made easily accessible with the ```igraph``` package. A complete tutorial on how to use igraph can be found [here](http://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph).

``` r
marvel_tidy <- marvel_tidy %>%
  filter(Value != "0") %>%
  select(-Value)

library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

g <- graph_from_data_frame(marvel_tidy, directed = TRUE)

marvel_centrality <- data.frame(degree(g, mode="in")) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>%
  arrange(desc(degree.g..mode....in..))
colnames(marvel_centrality) <- c("Name", "Degree")

marvel_centrality %>% head(5)
```

    ##              Name Degree
    ## 1        Iron Man      9
    ## 2 Captain America      9
    ## 3       Nick Fury      8
    ## 4            Thor      7
    ## 5            Hulk      6


``` r
marvel_closeness <- data.frame(closeness(g, mode="all", weights=NA)) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>%
  arrange(desc(closeness.g..mode....all...weights...NA.))
colnames(marvel_closeness) <- c("Name", "Closeness")

marvel_closeness %>% head(6)
```

    ##                         Name  Closeness
    ## 1     Avengers: Infinity War 0.01612903
    ## 2    Avengers: Age of Ultron 0.01351351
    ## 3                   Iron Man 0.01351351
    ## 4            Captain America 0.01351351
    ## 5                   Avengers 0.01282051
    ## 6 Captain America: Civil War 0.01282051


The central characters are Iron Man and Captain America (*ex aequo*), followed by Nick Fury, Thor and Hulk. The central movies are the three Avengers movies and *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).

## An interactive visualization of the Marvel Universe Network

Now that we know the central characters and movies, we can color them (in red and orange) and plot the full network.

``` r
set.seed(1)
g2 <- graph_from_data_frame(marvel_tidy, directed=T)

central_Character <- c("Iron Man", "Captain America", "Nick Fury", "Thor", "Hulk")
V(g2)[central_Character]$color <- "red"

central_films <- c("Avengers: Infinity War", "Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Avengers", "Captain America: Civil War")
V(g2)[central_films]$color <- "orange"

plot(g2, edge.arrow.size = 0.3, vertex.label.color="black", 
     vertex.label.dist = 0.3, vertex.size = 5, edge.curved = 0.2,
     layout = layout_with_fr,
     main = "Central Characters and Movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe")
```

The readability is quite bad. Making the plot interactive will help. 

Making interactive an igraph object with {visNetwork} is surprisingly easy. Just play with the interactive network below.

``` r
library("visNetwork")

data <- toVisNetworkData(g2)
visNetwork(nodes = data$nodes, edges = data$edges, height = "500px", width = "100%",
           main = "Central Characters and Movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = T, hover = T), nodesIdSelection = T)
```
