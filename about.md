My name is Félix Luginbühl. I hold a Master's degree in European Studies and a Master's degree in Sociology, both from the University of Geneva, Switzerland.

This blog is about R programming and data visualisation. In my blog posts, I try to follow the principle of economy: a minimum of lines for a maximum of clarity. 

The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on my [Github page](https://github.com/lgnbhl) and proudly aggregated to [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/).

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lgnbhl).
