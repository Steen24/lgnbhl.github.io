I'm Félix Luginbühl, a data analyst, R developer and [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) architect. I build data tools for organizations.

Curious about what I can do for your organisation? 

* Have a look at my [Project page](https://felixluginbuhl.com/project/).

## Softwares

In my spare time, I developed two R packages:

- [wikisourcer](https://lgnbhl.github.io/wikisourcer){:target="_blank"} to download public domain works from Wikisource.
- [polyglot](https://lgnbhl.github.io/polyglot){:target="_blank"} to learn foreign language vocabulary in the R console.
