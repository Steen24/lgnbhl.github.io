My name is Félix Luginbühl. I hold a Master's degree in European Studies and in Sociology, both from the University of Geneva, Switzerland.

I developed two R packages:

- [polyglot](https://lgnbhl.github.io/polyglot){:target="_blank"} to learn foreign language vocabulary in the R console 
- [wikisourcer](https://lgnbhl.github.io/wikisourcer){:target="_blank"} to download public domain works from Wikisource
